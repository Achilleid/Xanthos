Diary Update:

I've had to remove the latest software update. I cant find my notes and I'm afriad I may have misplaced them.
Jason's got sloppy and slipped up. I cant make the same mistake he did. He will take advantage just like I did. 
Once we have our opportunity we need to get into the lock, delete everything and get out. Then and only then will we be free. 
The only problem is Achilles, he keeps getting in the way. We need to lose him for good.
